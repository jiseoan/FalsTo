Welcome to FalsTo!
-------------------

This is an early version of FalsTo, a code editor for HTML, CSS, PHP
and JavaScript that's *built* in HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript. 

What makes FalsTo different from other Server-System?

* **Do it yourself.** Because FalsTo is open source, and built with HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript, you can help build the Server-System for the Everythings.

You can see some [screenshots of FalsTo](https://github.com/jiseoan/FalsTo/FalsTo-Screenshots) on the wiki
